How to use Git: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4&t=175s)

A. git add -A   <-- will add all files
or
. git add -f <filename> <-- will add the file being updated


B. git status <-- will confirm what will be committed

C. git commit -m "put in a very descriptive message about what was commited"

d. git pull origin master <-- this pulls down any changes made by others and is a good habit (for now)

e. git push origin master <-- this push the code up to the master branch

---

WORKFLOW:

1. Create a branch, for example, to work on the html structure.
    $ git branch html-structure  <-- here "html-structure" is a random name

2. Check which branches are available:
    $ git branch

3. Then checkout that branch so I can start working on it.
    $ git checkout html-structure




other commands:

$ git reset   <-- this resets the commit
$ git log <-- shows what just happened
